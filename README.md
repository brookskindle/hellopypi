Small package to test the functionality of uploading to pypi.

Sample output (after installation)
```python
>>> import hellopypi
Hello, Pypi!
```

Works in python 2 and python 3.

> Note: there is a hellopypi package on the official pypi site. This is **not**
> that project. This is a small project I created to test upload of a project
> to the pypi test server.
